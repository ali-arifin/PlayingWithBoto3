# PlayingWithBoto3
Leveraging Python to interact with AWS

I was introduced to the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) in early 2023. It can be used to create, configure, and manage AWS services (for example, Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3). The SDK provides an object-oriented API as well as low-level access to AWS services.

I really enjoyed this course from Datacamp:
